Simpleconvention is a LAMP stack application designed to manage the back end of running a convention (comic book conventions, home and garden conventions, etc.) and provide a front end accessible to the public with which they can interact with the convention.

The application is written in procedural PHP without the use of any framework and with few dependencies.

Features include:

* Site registration for users.
* Convention badge purchase and registration for users.
* Convention store.
* Event creation and listing.
* Guest speaker entry and listing.
* User event and guest speaker signup.
* Scheduling conflict prevention throughout all guest, event, and signup features.
* A basic online store (default setup uses Stripe.js)
* Basic forums.
* Responsive design using Bootstrap.

The application is designed for small- to mid-sized conventions that have an in-house web developer familiar enough with PHP to take an existing application, get it up-and-running, and then modify it as needed.
